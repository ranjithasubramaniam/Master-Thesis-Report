## Learning Shape Based Features for Robust Neural Representation.
## Overview
In contrast to humans, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are shown to be biased towards texture rather than shape for image recognition tasks.  This thesis is aimed to improve the shape based decision making of CNNs. In this work, I Proposed an effective approach using edge information of images along with a technique called style randomization which reduces the texture bias in the feature space of CNNs to enhance their shape based representations. Different evaluation strategies are used and it is shown that the proposed approach encodes stronger shape bias than existing works. Further, the significance of improved shape bias on common image corruptions like noise, blur, etc., is studied and is shown that there exists no clear correlation between the improved shape bias of CNN and its robustness against corruptions. A further study is conducted to understand the adaptability of a network pretrained on natural images to data from different distributions and is shown that a CNN trained on natural images also encodes robust representations but these representations are not leveraged in its affine layers.
